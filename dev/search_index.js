The first column will be the main_cat argument in the function below. It should take as many values as you will have groups of bar charts. In the example, it takes three values, resulting in 3 groups of stacked charts. This column should be ordered [a a b b c c].\n\nThe second column will be the sub_cat argument – the sub-category. This column can only take two values. These values will correspond with the two bars in each group. In the example, there are two bars in each group (with three groups, six total bars). This column should be ordered [a b a b a b].\n\nThe rest of the columns will take numeric values. There should be one column per component of each stacked bar chart. For example, if the bar charts have three components, there will be three columns corresponding to each component. Each row of these columns should sum to 1 or 100. A maximum of three columns can be passed. If values are decimals, multiply them by 100 before running this function.\n\nThe \"range\" argument should take a range of integers (1:2, 4:5) which correspond to the indexes of the columns with numeric values.\n\nThe mainlabs argument should be an array of strings (Array{String,1}) which correspond to the maincat argument. This creates the labels for each set of grouped bars.\n\nThe sublabs argument should be an array of strings (Array{String,1}) which correspond to the subcat argument. This creates the labels for each bar in each group.\n\nThe orders of the strings in both of these arrays matter!\n\ndf = DataFrame(main=[\"ab\",\"ab\",\"bc\",\"bc\",\"cd\",\"cd\"],sub=[\"a\",\"b\",\"a\",\"b\",\"a\",\"b\"],x1=[65,55,65,55,65,55,],x2 = [25,35,25,35,25,35],x3 = [10,10,10,10,10,10])\nPlate10(df, :main, :sub,3:5, [\"ab\", \"bc\",\"cd\"],[\"a\",\"b\"],[\"x1\",\"x2\",\"x3\"], \"title\")\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#DuBoisPlots.Plate25","page":"Home","title":"DuBoisPlots.Plate25","text":"Replicates Plate 25 (Spiral line chart).\n\nYou must pass a DataFrame with two columns.
