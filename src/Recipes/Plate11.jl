Replicates Plate 11 (Unusual line chart).

You must pass a DataFrame two columns. The first column should be strings with the names of each
category in the data. The second column should be numeric values corresponding to each of those
categories (the name of this column should be passed as a symbol in the `vals` argument). There can
only be 4 rows (maximum of 4 categories).

```julia
data = CSV.read(joinpath(@__DIR__,"../../data/original/Plate11.csv"),DataFrame)
z = Plate11(data, :Population,[-0.0,0.12], [0.09,0.1], [0.025,0.075], [0.03,-0.09], [0.035,-0.035],
"no", "City and Rural Population \n 1890.", " negroes in cities \n of over 10,000 inhabitants",
" negroes in cities \n from 5,000 to 10,000", " \n negroes \n in cities \n from \n 2,500 to 5,000",
" Negroes living in the country and villages")

 # plot them, submit the string "Auto" as the value for each of the position inputs. Case-sensitive.
 #
 # In order to position them manually, submit five arrays for the values of lab1_pos through lab5_pos. They are
 # inputs that take floats or integers as elements in the arrays. The arrays need to have one
 # columns each and two rows. In order to manually position the labels, simply input those
 # points (coordinates).
